# messenger

A messenger application written in node.js using socket.io for communication and leveldb for storage.  The idea is to create something iMessage/WhatsApp-like that is usable on mobile devices and through a web interface and is minimal, light, fast and very hip.

## Install

     npm install
     ./messenger
